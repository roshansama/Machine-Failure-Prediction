# Machine-Failure-Prediction
 In manufacturing industries, unexpected machine failures lead to significant downtime, increased maintenance costs, and loss of productivity. While traditional maintenance practices rely on scheduled or reactive approaches, they often fail to optimize resource utilization or prevent failures effectively.

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive maintenance system using machine learning to anticipate equipment failures based on historical sensor data. By predicting whether a machine is likely to fail, the system enables proactive maintenance, reduces downtime, and improves operational efficiency.
